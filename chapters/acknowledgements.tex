\begin{abstract}

I want to thank my supervising professor at \gls{item}, Poul Einar Heegard, for lots of valuable feedback and many interesting discussions during my work on this thesis, and Svein Willassen, my supervisor at appear.in, for proposing the topic, supplying me with production data from appear.in and valuable insight both into the industry and to many technical aspects of WebRTC.

I'd also like to extend my gratitude to Martin Kirkholt Melhus, both for constructive input on the execution of the experiments and early feedback on the thesis.

Lastly, to the wonderful people I've been sharing an office with the last year, thank you for listening.
