This project demonstrates a video conferencing solution using a hybrid network topology, vastly improving the QoS. For existing providers utilizing a centralized topology adopting this work leads to lower costs and better performance for users, while for providers utilizing peer-to-peer topologies today can now increase the capacity of their service.

The system dynamically selects the best topology for a given conversation, depending on device characteristics.
