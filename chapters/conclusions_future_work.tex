\section{Future Work}\label{sec:future_work}

Develop toolkit for more automated test suites, to enable tests to be run more frequently to see the effect of code changes.

Run tests against Hangout and Skype, to see how well they stack up.

\todo[inline]{In case a node does not have sufficient bandwidth for receiving $(n-1)$ streams of $BW_{min}$, the routing algorithm will fail. In case this happens, a smart system could fall back to a \gls{vas}-based system. However, in the case where the node has sufficient bandwidth for receiving \emph{some} streams, but not all, the user could be presented with an interface that allows prioritizing certain nodes for always showing continous presence, while the rest share a \gls{vas}-link to the node. Extending the system to accomodate both a VAS node and respecting commodity preferences was considered out of scope for this paper, but is a topic for further research.}
