\todo[inline]{In case a node does not have sufficient bandwidth for receiving $(n-1)$ streams of $BW_{min}$, the routing algorithm will fail. In case this happens, a smart system could fall back to a \gls{vas}-based system. However, in the case where the node has sufficient bandwidth for receiving \emph{some} streams, but not all, the user could be presented with an interface that allows prioritizing certain nodes for always showing continous presence, while the rest share a \gls{vas}-link to the node. Extending the system to accomodate both a VAS node and respecting commodity preferences was considered out of scope for this paper, but is a topic for further research.}
