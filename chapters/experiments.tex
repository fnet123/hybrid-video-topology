\chapter{Experiments}\label{chp:experiments}

In this chapter the sample implementation is introduced, we'll take a look at the test environment, and present the results.

\section{Test Setup}

Since much of the software to be tested is proprietary and very consumer-oriented, measuring their latency and bandwidth utilization

To be able to test the different configurations, we used several computers in a lab running the software under testing, with a timer running on their screen


\section{Implementation}\label{sec:implementation}

\todo{Write about how the implementation was done}


\section{Results}

\todo{Gather some metrics from running the implementation in a prod environment}
