\chapter{The get-bw-alloc script}
\label{chp:get-bw-alloc}

This is the Python script\footnote{Available online at \url{https://github.com/thusoy/hybrid-video-topology/blob/master/tools/find_allocation.py}} introduced in the \autoref{chp:suggested-solution}, which computes an efficient video routing for a flow network from a file of cases and a set of parameters.

Necessary dependencies for running the script include the glpk LP solver (available for both Windows and *nix), and the Python bindings provided by the \texttt{pulp} library\footnote{Install with \texttt{pip install pulp}}.
