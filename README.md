# hybrid-video-topology
Unifying the best of p2p, SFU and MCUs topologies.


Roadmap
-------

By 25.03: Have benchmarked existing solutions, found their bandwidth utilization, latency and CPU usage in the example conversations.

By 06.04: Have finalized the algorithm for route selection, but maybe with imperfect parameters. Write about the physical test setup.

By 06.05: Have tested the algorithm on the example setup to find the best parameters

By 13.05: Finalized the introduction, background and experiments chapters

By 20.05: Write the results and discussion chapters

By 27.05: Finalize the rest

By 04.06: Get feedback and incorporate changes
